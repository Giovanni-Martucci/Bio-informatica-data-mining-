This project aims to identify patients with similar tumors by analyzing the biological processes of different patients and searching for similar patterns among them.
The software and algorithms used are:
- "Mithrill" algorithm, which was used to map expression values to their corresponding genes in the network and assigned a perturbation value for each gene of each patient.
- "Multimotif", a software capable of calculating motifs for the meta-pathways of each patient, finding the most recurrent labeled subgraphs in the network.
